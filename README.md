Groc-POS is a mobile-based point-of-sale system designed to cater to the needs of small retail stores in Pakistan. It's on a mission to help these businesses manage their inventory and streamline their checkout process using the latest technology. üöÄ

# Problem Statement:

In the context of small retail stores in Pakistan, managing inventory and streamlining the checkout process remains a significant challenge. These businesses often grapple with outdated processes, manual inventory management, and a lack of efficient point-of-sale solutions. The absence of modern technology in day-to-day operations leads to inefficiencies, resource wastage, and a suboptimal shopping experience for both store owners and customers.

Additionally, the identification of grocery items during the checkout process poses a hurdle, often resulting in delays and errors. This not only impacts the speed of transactions but also contributes to an overall decrease in operational efficiency.

Recognizing these challenges, the need for an accessible, affordable, and technologically advanced point-of-sale system tailored for small retail stores in Pakistan becomes evident. Groc-POS aims to address these pain points by introducing a mobile-based solution that integrates Flutter, Dart, Firebase, Python, and TensorFlow technologies. Through this innovative approach, Groc-POS seeks to revolutionize the retail landscape, offering a comprehensive solution to enhance operational efficiency, improve inventory management, and elevate the overall retail experience for both store owners and customers.

## Project Highlights:

### üì∏ Object Recognition Function:
Quick and accurate identification of grocery items using your smartphone's camera. We have developed a computer vision model specifically trained on Pakistani Prroducts. For this we have collected a custom dataset based on Pakistani Products. Currently there are 17 differnet products added in the project. 

### üí∞ Mobile App Based POS System:
Groc-POS offers all the features that a Traditional POS system offers but just by using your mobile phone.

### üîÑ Resource Optimization:
Retail store owners can save time, space, and resources by using their smartphones for sales-related tasks.

Groc-POS is revolutionizing how small retail stores operate, transforming the retail industry in Pakistan. üåê‚ú®
